# Veilify

Veilify is a live webcam manipulation tool that allows you to make changes to your camera feed before it's displayed in video calls (Google Meet, Zoom, etc.) or on streaming programs.

You can use OBS's Virtual Camera ability to capture the output of Veilify: https://obsproject.com/.

Facial recognition ability is built using Google's MediaPipe: https://google.github.io/mediapipe/.
